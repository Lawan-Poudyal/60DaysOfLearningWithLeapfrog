# Day 46 

- avoidable bias(dif betwn human and training set error)
- variance (diff betwn dev/test and training error)

## To Improve your model
- if avoidable bais (train bigger model, better optimization momentum, rms adam etc, better NN architecture/hyperparameters)
- if variance (get more training data, Regularization, better NN arhitecture)
