# Day 54

Things I learnt:

- Pooling (max and avg pooling)
- basic CNN architecture

## max pooling
- use the maximum value in given square

## avegrave pooling
- take average of the values present in the square

## CNN architecture
basic CNN architecture (layers) looks like this
-  conv - pool - conv - pool - FC (fully connected) - FC - softmax
